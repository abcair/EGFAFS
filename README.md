EGFAFS
Feature selection (FS) is a vital step of data mining and machine learning, especially for analyzing the data in high-dimensional feature space. Gene expression data usually consists of relatively few samples characterized by high-dimensional feature space. Then they are not suitable to be processed by simple methods, such as filter-based and wrapper methods. In this study, we proposed a novel feature selection algorithm for gene expression data based on Explosion Gravitation Field Algorithm, which is called EGFAFS in brief. To reduce the dimensions of the feature space to acceptable di-mensions, we created a recommended feature pool by a series of Random Forests based on the Gini index. Then we can pay more attention to the features in the recommended feature pool. To verify the performance of EGFAFS for FS, we test EGFAFS on eight gene expression datasets compared with four heuristic-based FS methods (GA, PSO, SA, and DE) and four other FS methods (Boruta, HSICLasso, DNN-FS, and EGSG). The results show that EGFAFS has better performance for FS on gene expression data in terms of most evaluation metrics than the other eight heuristic algorithms. The fact that the genes EGFAFS selected play an essential role in the differential co-expression network and some biological functions further demonstrates the significance of EGFAFS for FS.
